🎤 **Favorite Quote:** "In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or step back into safety." - Abraham Maslow
💬 **Personality Traits:** *I'd say I'm driven, kind, empathetic, steadfast, a perfectionist and a bit of a goof all rolled into one, but I was never any good at identifying my own traits or strengths/weaknesses for that matter, as I either overthink or underappreciate*

💬 **Favorite Platforms:** *YouTube and Bluesky, YouTube for obvious reasons and Bluesky because Twitter has always been a shitshow*
📅 **Special Events or Milestones:** *Dec. 30th, 2021 - When I hit affiliate on Twitch finally. Oct. 20th, 2015 - When I started the "Oxydize" YouTube channel. Sept. 22nd - Sept. 25th, 2023 - My first special guest appearance at Comic Con Africa as a keynote Speaker. (and to avoid stabbage [jk babes] from my Queen) Oct. 18th, 2024 - When <@218970213574508555> and I became officially partners in crime.*  
🧠 **Inspiration:** *I'm very inspired by my peers in the entertainment and Content Creation industry to continue going, I'm also inspired by those close to me to continue to grow and improve myself as a person, to appreciate life as is, rather than wish for perfection. Also, my Queen 💚 inspires me to keep going.*
🌱 **Growth:** *I want to continue to push myself to improve my approach to treating people with as much kindness and respect as I humanly can, and I also continue to strive towards redefining my own outlook on my existence as in the past; I wasn't sure I deserved it. I want to be the best version of myself I can be in the present, and live every day like it could be my last.*
